    <issue
        id="InlinedApi"
        severity="Error"
        message="Field requires API level 23 (current min is 21): `android.provider.Settings#ACTION_MANAGE_WRITE_SETTINGS`"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Using inlined constants on older versions"
        explanation="This check scans through all the Android API field references in the application and flags certain constants, such as static final integers and Strings, which were introduced in later versions. These will actually be copied into the class files rather than being referenced, which means that the value is available even when running on older devices. In some cases that&apos;s fine, and in other cases it can result in a runtime crash or incorrect behavior. It depends on the context, so consider the code carefully and decide whether it&apos;s safe and can be suppressed or whether the code needs to be guarded.&#xA;&#xA;If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` files.&#xA;&#xA;If your code is **deliberately** accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.">

        severity="Warning"
        message="Use &quot;`start`&quot; instead of &quot;`left`&quot; to ensure correct behavior in right-to-left locales"
        category="Internationalization:Bidirectional Text"
        priority="5"
        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.&#xA;&#xA;For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. **NOTE**: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add **both** the older left/right attributes **as well as** the new start/end attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/end attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.&#xA;&#xA;(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask. Therefore, you can use `gravity=&quot;start&quot;` rather than `gravity=&quot;left|start&quot;`.)">
